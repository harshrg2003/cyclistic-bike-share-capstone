## üóÇ Project Structure
- **data/raw/** ‚Üí Raw monthly CSV files (Jan‚ÄìApr 2021).  
- **data/processed/** ‚Üí Cleaned & aggregated CSVs used for analysis.  
- **plots/** ‚Üí Visualizations from R (ggplot2).  
- **reports/** ‚Üí Full R Markdown report (PDF) + Presentation (PPT).  
- **scripts/** ‚Üí R scripts for data cleaning & analysis.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB file size limit, only **sample data** is included.  
The full dataset can be re-created by running the R scripts on the original Divvy data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Packages
- **R** (tidyverse, lubridate, janitor, ggplot2)  
- RStudio / Posit Cloud  
- GitHub for version control

## üìà Key Insights
- Members: frequent, shorter weekday rides (commuting).  
- Casuals: longer leisure rides, mainly weekends.  
- Seasonal increase in ridership (esp. Mar‚ÄìApr).  
- Casuals use docked bikes more, with the longest trip lengths.  

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
- Promote annual memberships emphasizing cost savings.  
- Target weekend casual riders with digital ads.  
- Highlight flexibility & value of annual plans.

## Project Workflow (Google DA Capstone Process)
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ask

Defined business task: support marketing strategy to increase annual memberships.

Identified stakeholders: Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing team.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare

Collected Divvy Trip Data (Jan‚ÄìApr 2021).

Validated data source: publicly available, real-world dataset.

Noted limitations: only a 4-month subset used for analysis.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Process

Cleaned column names (using janitor).

Converted timestamps with lubridate.

Created new features: ride length, day-of-week, month, hour.

Removed invalid rides (‚â§0 mins or >24 hrs).

Checked for missing values & duplicates.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, IQR, SD).

Hypothesis tests: t-test & Wilcoxon test.

Visualizations (ggplot2):

Ride length distribution

Rides by weekday, month, and bike type

Average ride duration trends

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Share

Prepared R Markdown report (PDF).

Created presentation slides with key insights.

Summarized recommendations for Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing strategy.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Act

Insights will guide targeted marketing campaigns (focus on converting casuals to members).
